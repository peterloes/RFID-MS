Platform for Animal Observation 

An efficient system to monitor animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection lead to long lasting collection periods
-	Applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	High observation quality through low disturbance of the animals

- Time Synchronization with atomic clock once a day to ensure optimal data quality
- Current Control twice a day
- Forecast for Battery-Change implemented
- Energy Bypass so that Date and Time are maintained even when changing battery
- Hyperterminal Output to get real-time data in the field
- Low-Power Device:sleep: 12V@40µA awake: 12V@12mA
